ShopSystemMod 🛒💰

A full coin-based in-game shop for Mindustry. Earn coins as you play, spend them on resources, units, boosts, pets, and special features — all wrapped inside a simple and intuitive shop interface.

🌟 Overview

ShopSystemMod introduces a flexible progression-based economy system.
As you fight waves, defeat enemies, complete daily tasks, and interact with the game, you collect coins. These coins can be spent on items that help you push further, build faster, or simply have more fun.

The shop expands the more you play, unlocking new content based on waves completed and your overall shop level.

🎮 How to Access the Shop

1. Open Settings
2. Scroll down to Shop System
3. Tap Open Shop
4. Browse and purchase anything you have unlocked

Your coin balance is always visible in the top-left corner of the screen.
