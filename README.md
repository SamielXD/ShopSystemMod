# ShopSystemMod 🛒💰
A full coin-based in-game shop for Mindustry. Earn coins as you play, spend them on resources, units, boosts, pets, and special features — all wrapped inside a simple and intuitive shop interface.

## 🌟 Overview
ShopSystemMod introduces a flexible progression-based economy system. As you fight waves, defeat enemies, complete daily tasks, and interact with the game, you collect coins. These coins can be spent on items that help you push further, build faster, or simply have more fun.

The shop expands the more you play, unlocking new content based on waves completed and your overall shop level.

## 🎮 How to Access the Shop
1. Click the **SHOP** button on the right side of your screen
2. Browse categories and purchase anything you have unlocked
3. Check out Stats, Rewards, and Redeem Codes
4. Listen for satisfying sound effects when you interact!

Your coin balance is always visible along with your VIP level and Shop level in the UI.

## ⚠️ Known Issues
- Work system may fail to track progress occasionally
- Rapid clicking can sometimes glitch the UI
- Small screens may display UI elements incorrectly
- Some achievements trigger with a slight delay
- Sound effects require the sound files in your mod's `sounds/` folder

Nothing game-breaking — just small quirks that will be refined over time.

## 🔊 Sound Files Required
Make sure you have these sound files in your mod's `sounds/` folder:
- `pop.ogg` - Button clicks and UI interactions
- `switch.ogg` - Menu switching and special events
- `coins.ogg` - Coin earning and spending sounds

Without these files, the mod will still work but won't have sound effects!
